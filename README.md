# ANN-using-Tensorflow
Implementation of a simple Artificial Neural Network using Tensorflow library. 

This code was written to train a Neural Network to be trained for a 12-class classification problem as part of a course contest. Code was written over a period of 3 hours and hence it is not quite scalable as of now. Could not tune hyperparameters much due to time constraint which led to use of pre-existing ANN library in sklearn.
